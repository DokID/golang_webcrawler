# INDA Project: Web crawler

This web crawler project aims at creating a program that is capable of mapping websites. The crawler itself will be written in Go, and support tools are most likely going to be written in Python.

## Core features

The crawler should be able to:

* request a webpage using a hyperlink,
* parse webpage content,
* locate hyperlinks on the page,
* spread using the found hyperlinks,
* catalog pages visited.

## Installation instructions

Will be added later.

## Testing process

For the most part, the crawler will be tested using small, controlled environments; most likely a set of interlinked, text based pages located behind localhost adresses.

Additional analytics tools will be tested using unit testing.
